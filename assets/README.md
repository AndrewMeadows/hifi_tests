# Assets
This folder contains a number of sub-folders, each storing a different class of entity.  These entities can be used by the test scripts as needed.
## Models
Models include Wavefront OBJ (object) and Autodesk FBX (filmbox) models, as well as avatars in our FST format.  The folder also contains KTX, PNG files used as textures, as well as Blender source files.
## Scenes
These are JSON files that are world models.  These are usually useful for performance testing, as they can be quite complex.
## Shaders
These are shaders used for specific tests, such as procedural shading.  They are in the GLSL language.
## Skymaps
A number of texture files (JPG, KTX) that are used to create skyboxes for the various tests.
## Textures
