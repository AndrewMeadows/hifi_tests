# Auto Tester

The auto-tester is a stand alone application that provides a mechanism for regression testing.  The general idea is simple:
* Each test folder has a script that produces a set of snapshots.
* The snapshots are compared to a 'canonical' set of images that have been produced beforehand.
* The result, if any test failed, is a zipped folder describing the failure.

Auto-tester has 4 functions, separated into 4 tabs:
1. Creating tests, MD files and recursive scripts
2. Evaluating the results of running tests
3. TestRail interface
4. Windows task bar utility (Windows only)
## Setup
### Windows 10
#### Tests Repository
* Clone the hifi_tests repository - this is not needed to run tests nor evaluate their results.
```
git clone https://github.com/highfidelity/hifi_tests.git
```
#### Auto-Tester
1. Download the installer by browsing to [here](<https://hifi-content.s3.amazonaws.com/nissim/autoTester/AutoTester-Installer.exe>).
2. Double click on the installer and install to a convenient location

3. To run the auto-tester, double click **auto-tester.exe**.

## Using the auto-tester
The auto-tester provides the following 5 functions:
1. Evaluate a single test
2. Evaluate tests recursively
3. Create a recursive test script
4. Create a test case
5. Delete old snapshots

Each of the 4 functions asks the user to select a folder.

## Evaluation - general
A checkbox is provided for de-selecting interactive mode.  If this checkbox ix selected then each error will be displayed to the user; otherwise, the evaluation will procede till completion.  In both cases, all errors are logged to file.
For each failed test, a zipped folder is created within the test folder, named *TestResults*.  This folder contains a folder for each failed test named *Failure_n*, numbered sequentially.  Each folder contains 4 files:
1. Expected Image
2. Actual Image
3. Difference Image
4. TestResults - a text file providing details of the test folder, the original image names, and the size of the mismatch.
### Evaluate Test
Evaluating a test is performed after running a **test.js** script to create new snapshots.  After selecting the folder, the images are compared in lexical order.  If the similarity between any image pair does not pass a fixed threshold, the image pair is displayed and the user can select to accept the difference, fail this specific test case, or abort testing.

### Evaluate Tests Recursively
This is a recursive version of the previous function.  Auto-tester will recurse through all folders from the selected folder.  A test will be evaluated if the following is true:
* The folder contains a **test.js** script
* The number of actual and expected snapshots is the same (see Create Test for an explanation)
### Create a recursive test script
Auto-tester will create a script named **allTests.js** that will call all **test.js** scripts found in the folder, and any subfolders.  An example of the script created is:
```
// This is an automatically generated file, created by auto-tester
var test1 = Script.require("file:///D:/GitHub/hifi-tests/tests/content/entity/zone/ambientLightInheritance/test.js");
var test2 = Script.require("file:///D:/GitHub/hifi-tests/tests/content/entity/zone/create/test.js");
var test3 = Script.require("file:///D:/GitHub/hifi-tests/tests/content/entity/zone/createMultipleZones/test.js");

var test1HasNotStarted = true;
var test2HasNotStarted = true;
var test3HasNotStarted = true;

// Check every second if the current test is complete and the next test can be run
var testTimer = Script.setInterval(
    function() {
        if (test1HasNotStarted) {
            test1HasNotStarted = false;
            test1.test();
            print("******started test 1******");
        }

        if (test1.complete && test2HasNotStarted) {
            test2HasNotStarted = false;
            test2.test();
            print("******started test 2******");
        }

        if (test2.complete && test3HasNotStarted) {
            test3HasNotStarted = false;
            test3.test();
            print("******started test 3******");
        }

        if (test3.complete) {
            print("******stopping******");
            Script.stop();
        }

    },

    1000
);

// Stop the timer and clear the module cache
Script.scriptEnding.connect(
    function() {
        Script.clearInterval(testTimer);
        Script.require.cache = {};
    }
);
```
### Create a Test Case
A test case is created after running the test script.  Running the script produces a series of snapshots, named **hifi-snap-by-**_user name_**-on-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.jpg**.  This function simply renames these files to **ExpectedImage_1.jpg**, **ExpectedImage_2.jpg** and so on.  These files can be added to version control as they are a fixed asset of the test.
### Delete old snapshots
This button recursively deletes all snapshots created for testign (not the Expected Images).
